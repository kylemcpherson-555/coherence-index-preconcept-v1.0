## Overview

This repository hosts the **Pre-Concept Working Paper for the Coherence Index**, an early-stage academic framework proposing a new systemic measurement method for assessing coherence across informational, biophysical, human, and economic domains.

This document represents the final non-enabling public release prior to patent submission for the underlying mathematical formulation and source-code architecture of the Coherence Index and the Regenerative Coherence Index (RCI).

The PDF is provided for transparency, timestamped provenance, and academic accessibility.

## Abstract (Summary)

The global economy lacks a metric capable of capturing *systemic coherence* across interlinked human, informational, biophysical, and economic systems.  
This pre-concept framework introduces the **Coherence Index**, a geometric-mean–based early formulation that conceptualises coherence as a multi-domain phenomenon and outlines the philosophical, methodological, and structural foundations for a next-generation complementary economic indicator.

This paper intentionally excludes enabling details, full mathematical derivations, and source code, which remain protected pending patent application.
